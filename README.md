# Detection-of-COVID-19-using-X-Rays

In this Machile Learning model I have used numpy and Computer Vision to detect whether the given Xray is normal ot it has viral or it is COVID affected.I have downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.

Its request not to use this model in realtime since the dataset is too small and does not have all the possible COVID samples and might give you inaccurate answers. This model is trained for the sole purpose of learning and tresting my knowledge.
